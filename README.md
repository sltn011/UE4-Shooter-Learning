# UE4-Shooter-Learning
  
My first game made using Unreal Engine 4 - **Shooter Game** - team-based PvE third-person shooter!  
  
![Title](https://github.com/sltn011/UE4-Shooter-Learning/blob/master/Images/title.png)  
    
## Features:  
  1) Two maps with unique game modes:  
      **TestLevel** - map for two 2vs2 30-seconds rounds with 5 seconds respawns!  
      **Dust2** - map which mimics legendary Counter Strike de_dust2 map - five 90-seconds 5vs5 rounds where your goal is to eliminate enemy team! Each round team with most kills gets a score!  
        
  2) Two weapons to kill your enemies with - Assault Rifle and Plasma Rocket Launcher that deals AoE damage!  
    
  3) AI Controlled Bots that roam around the map and will kill you in seconds if you lower your guard for a moment!  
    
  4) Pick-ups that provide players with ammo and health!  
    
  5) Score board with every player's kills and deaths!
